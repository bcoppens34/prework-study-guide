## Description

Boot camp prework study guide for students

My motivation for this project was seeing how far I can push myself to learn something completely new
I built this project to myself that I can learn to code!
This project helps give me a couple of pointers when it comes to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
I've learned that this may be a lot harder than expected, but in completing the project I am excited to see where this goes.
